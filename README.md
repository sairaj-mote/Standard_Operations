6. `supernodes` : Holder for the supernode list. Can be updated in runtime while retriving data from blockchain using API. Stored in the Object format,

		{
			<supernodeFLOID> : {
				uri : <supernodeURI>
				...(otherProperties)
				}
			...(Other Supernodes)
		}

	 floCrypto.validateAddr(floID)
`validateAddr` check if the given Address is valid or not
1. floID - flo ID to validate 

#### 	Data Encryption
	 floCrypto.encryptData(data, publicKey)
`encryptData` encrypts the given data using public-key
1. data - data to encrypt
2. publicKey - public key of the recipient

#### 	Data Decryption
	 floCrypto.decryptData(data, privateKey)
`decryptData` decrypts the given data using private-key
1. data - encrypted data to decrypt (Object that was returned from encryptData)
2. privateKey - private key of the recipient

#### 	Sign Data
	 floCrypto.signData(data, privateKey)
`signData` signs the data using the private key
1. data - data to sign
2. privateKey - private key of the signer

####  Verify Signature
	 floCrypto.decryptData(data, signature, publicKey)
`decryptData` verifies signatue of the data using public-key
1. data - data of the given signature
2. signature - signature of the data
3. publicKey - public key of the signer

## FLO Blockchain API Operations
`floBlockchainAPI` object method can be used to send/recieve data to/from blockchain.These functions are asynchronous and return a promise. Contains the following functions.

#### promisedAJAX
	floBlockchainAPI.promisedAJAX(method, uri)
`promisedAJAX` resolves a responce from server on success or rejects the responce on failure.
1. method - GET/POST
  a.GET - Requests data from a specified resource.
  b.POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
2. uri(Uniform Resource Identifier) - identifier for AJAX resource. It is used to create URL(Uniform Resource Locator) for further operations.

#### getBalalnce
	floBlockchainAPI.getBalance(addr)
`getBalance` resolves balance for specified FLO address.
1. addr - FLO address for which balance has to be retrieved.

#### sendTx 
	floBlockchainAPI.sendTx(senderAddr, receiverAddr, sendAmt, PrivKey, floData = '')
`sendTx` sends a transaction to blockchain, resolves transaction id if the transacation was succsessful. 
1. senderAddr - FLO address from which the data and amount has to be sent.
2. receiverAddr - FLO address to which has to be sent.
3. sendAmt - Amount of FLO coins to be sent to receiver.
4. PrivKey - Private key of sender to verify sender.
5. floData - Actual FLO data that will be sent as string of 1040 characters.

#### getNewTxs 
	floBlockchainAPI.getNewTxs(addr, ignoreOld)
`getNewTxs` gets new transactions from blockchain since last sync using API.
1. addr - FLO address for which the transactions has to be synced 
2. ignoreOld - Last synced transactions.

## Compact IndexedDB operations
`compactIDB` operations can be used to perform basic IndexedDB operations such as add, read/write, modify and remove.Contains following operations.

#### setDefaultDB 
	compactIDB.setDefaultDB(dbName)
`setDefaultDB` sets the database on which further operations will be performed.
1. dbName - This is the name of default database to be used.

#### initDB
	compactIDB.initDB(dbName, objectStores = {})
`initDB` initializes new IndexedDB.
1. dbName - Specifies database to be initialized.
2. objectStores - This is an object containing various objectStores to be initiazed when creating an IDB.

#### openDB
	compactIDB.openDB(dbName)
`openDB` returns a promise that resolves to a default database object.

#### deleteDB
	compactIDB.deleteDB(dbName)
`deleteDB` deletes the specified database.

2. data  - data that has to be written in specified object store.

#### addData
	compactIDB.addData(obsName, data)
`addData` writes new data into object store. If data already exists, it will return an error.
